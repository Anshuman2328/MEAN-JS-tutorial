        <h1>Ninja Class II: [See Ninja Class I first]</h1>
        <p>Complete the below challenges using the Ninja Class from the previous assignment.</p>

            <p>1.) .punch():
            Add a new method to your Ninja class called .punch(). This method will take another Ninja instance and subtract 5 Health from the Ninja we passed in.</p>
            <p>2.) .kick(): Now add a method to your Ninja class called .kick(). Kick will subtract 15 Health for each point of Strength the calling Ninja has, and like .punch() will take another Ninja instance.</p>
            <p>3.) Validations: Update .punch() and .kick() so that they only accept Instances of the Ninja class. Hint: You will need to find a way to check the constructor of an instance. You will often need to consult outside documentation to find solutions for particular features.</p>
